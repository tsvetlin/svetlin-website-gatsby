# My Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, [svetlin.eu](https://svetlin.eu), which I built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

I chose Gatsby for its excellent developer experience, robust static site generation, built-in image optimization, and SEO-friendly design. Developing this project allowed me to explore Gatsbyâ€™s features and enjoy its flexibility.

Feel free to explore, learn from, or use this project as inspiration for your own Gatsby-based websites!
